#BÃ©zier Drawer

Future work: I wanted to have better control over where in the point list the new points are inserted. However, I started to realize that there are several different options I would have to provide, and it would take a lot of coding time for a non functional requirement. So I decided to implement it later. The most generic way I thought was to implement a spinner where you choose the index where the new point will be inserted, and a check box that makes this index be counted from the last position. For example, you could always insert a new point at the first index, at the second index, at the third index, and so on, or at the last index, at the second to last index, at the third to last index, and so on. Besides having to update the spinner's model's maximum value at every point insertion and removal, I might have to update the spinner value at every point insertion or removal when counting from the last, unless I use the value displayed and simply count from the last.
